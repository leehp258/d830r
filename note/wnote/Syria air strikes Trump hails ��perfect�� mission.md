US President Donald Trump has hailed an overnight military strike on Syria as "perfectly executed", adding: "Mission Accomplished".

The US, UK and France bombed three government sites, targeting what they said were chemical weapons facilities.

The strikes were in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma last week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said he condemned the Western strikes "in the most serious way".

Russia, Syria’s main ally, had threatened military retaliation if any Russian forces had been hit.

In early morning tweets from Washington, President Trump thanked France and the UK for "their wisdom and the power of their fine military".

He added: "So proud of our great military", saying that after extra funding it would be "the finest our country has ever had".

A Pentagon briefing on Saturday said the strikes had "set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back for years".

The wave of strikes is the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad’s government by Western powers in seven years of Syria’s civil war.

Responding to the strikes, Mr Assad said in comments published by his office: "This aggression will only make Syria and its people more determined to keep fighting and crushing terrorism in every inch of the country."

Sana, Syria’s official state news agency, called the Western action "a flagrant violation of international law".

"The American, French and British aggression against Syria will fail," it said.

Syria has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.

China said it opposed the use of force and that there could only be a political solution to the Syrian conflict.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel - who had ruled out joining the military action - said she supported the strikes as "necessary and appropriate".

Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted support for the strikes, saying those who use chemical weapons "must be held accountable".

Turkey said it viewed the airstrikes as "an appropriate response" to the Douma attack, according to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement.
